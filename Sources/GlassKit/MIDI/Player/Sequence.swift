/** A jazz improv sequence that orchestrates the different instruments to create music.
 
 To use it, follow this steps:
 1. Create one or more instruments like Piano/Bass/Drums
 
 let drums = Drums(withParts: [.snare, .hihats])
 2. Create a `Harmonization` with your desired key and type.
 
 let harmonization = Harmonization(key: .Eflat, type: .harmonicMinor)
 
 3. Create a new `Sequence` with your instruments and your harmonization. You can also provide a tempo *(default is 120 bpm)*
 
 let sequence = Sequence(harmonization: harmonization, tempo: 125, withInstruments: [drums, piano])
 
 3. Tell the sequence the order and the degree of the chords you want to follow. Then create an arrangement following that progresssion.
 
 sequence.steps += [2,5,1,3,6,7,1,2,4,5]
 sequence.createArrangement()
 
 4. Play the sequence and enjoy a great jazz improv.
